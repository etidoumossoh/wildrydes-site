# Building a Scalable Ride-Sharing Web Application on AWS

This project focuses on building an end-to-end application comprising 6 AWS services namely:
- AWS Amplify
- Amazon Cognito
- Dynamo DB
- LAMBDA
- API Gateway

The web application allows registered users to request registered unicorn rides from the WildRydes fleet. 

# Pre-requisites
- An AWS account
- AWS CLI installed on your device
- ArcGis account
- Text Editor. I used VSCode

# STEP ONE: Deploy a Static Website

We will use AWS Amplify to host our static website.
